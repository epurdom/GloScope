Version 1.7.3 (2025-09-20)
=====================================

- Changed `plotMDS` to be more versatile. ARGUMENTS HAVE CHANGED. Instead of `group_id`, user can now give any combination of `color_by` and `shape_by` to indicate variables to use for the ggplot. The function has also removed unnecessary ggplot commands, leaving those to the user to chose.
- Added function `plotHeatmap` as a wrapper to `pheatmap` function for plotting a heatmap of the GloScope divergence matrix
- Added functions `get_metrics`, `bootstrap_gloscope` to perform hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for testing differences between groups.

===================================

- Added functionality for custom GMM and kNN parameters in fitting
- Add aditional test cases and update documentation

Version 1.7.1 (2025-07-23)
====================================

- Change default number of GMM components to 6,8,...,24

Version 1.3.1 (2024-08-01)
=====================================
