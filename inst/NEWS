Version 2.1.1 (2025-09-27)
====================================
- Fix so handles if no column names which was creating error with latest version of `mclust`

Version 1.99.1 (2025-09-27)
====================================

- Changed default number of GMM components to 5,10,15,20

Version 1.99.0 (2025-09-20)
=====================================

- Changed name of argument to `gloscope` and `gloscope_proportion` from `dist_mat` to `dist_metric` to be more consistent in argument names
- Changed name of function `gloscope_proportion` to `gloscopeProp` for consistent naming conventions
- `gloscopeProp` now will calculated the total variation distance between cell-type proportions (`dist_metric="TV"`)
- `gloscopeProp` now will add the value `ep` to all counts, not just those that are zero.
- Changed `plotMDS` to be more versatile. ARGUMENTS HAVE CHANGED. Instead of `group_id`, user can now give any combination of `color_by` and `shape_by` to indicate variables to use for the ggplot. The function has also removed unnecessary ggplot commands, leaving those to the user to chose.
- Added function `plotHeatmap` as a wrapper to `pheatmap` function for plotting a heatmap of the GloScope divergence matrix
- Added functions `getMetrics`, `bootstrap_gloscope`, `bootCI` to perform hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for testing differences between groups.
- Added function `plotCI` to plot output of `bootCI`

Version 1.7.2 (2025-09-17)
===================================

- Added functionality for custom GMM and kNN parameters in fitting
- Added aditional test cases and update documentation

Version 1.7.1 (2025-07-23)
====================================

- Changed default number of GMM components to 6,8,...,24

Version 1.3.1 (2024-08-01)
=====================================

- Fixed bug which caused the `gloscopeProp` function to not be properly exported.

Version 1.1.1 (2024-05-01)
=====================================

- Added functionality to compute divergence matrix from cell-type proportion vectors

Version 0.99.5 (2023-10-23)
=====================================

- Fix typos in README and CITATION files

Version 0.99.4 (2023-10-03)
=====================================

- Improve example data and test cases
- Update documentation
- Fix Monte Carlo sampling edge case bug

Version 0.99.3 (2023-09-17)
=====================================

- Address feedback from Bioconductor review
- Catch edge case where more GMM components specified by user than cells

Version 0.99.2 (2023-08-09)
=====================================

- Fix issues in Bioconductor build report

Version 0.99.1 (2023-07-18)
=====================================

- Update ROxygen examples and test cases to use SingleCellExperiment data

Version 0.99.0 (2023-06-01)
=====================================

- This is the pre-submission version.
