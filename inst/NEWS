Version 1.99.1 (2025-09-27)
====================================

- Changed default number of GMM components to 5,10,15,20

Version 1.99.0 (2025-09-20)
=====================================

- Changed name of argument to `gloscope` and `gloscope_proportion` from `dist_mat` to `dist_metric` to be more consistent in argument names
- Changed name of function `gloscope_proportion` to `gloscopeProp` for consistent naming conventions
- `gloscopeProp` now will calculated the total variation distance between cell-type proportions (`dist_metric="TV"`)
- `gloscopeProp` now will add the value `ep` to all counts, not just those that are zero.
- Changed `plotMDS` to be more versatile. ARGUMENTS HAVE CHANGED. Instead of `group_id`, user can now give any combination of `color_by` and `shape_by` to indicate variables to use for the ggplot. The function has also removed unnecessary ggplot commands, leaving those to the user to chose.
- Added function `plotHeatmap` as a wrapper to `pheatmap` function for plotting a heatmap of the GloScope divergence matrix
- Added functions `getMetrics`, `bootstrap_gloscope`, `bootCI` to perform hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for testing differences between groups.
- Added function `plotCI` to plot output of `bootCI`

- Added functionality for custom GMM and kNN parameters in fitting
- Added aditional test cases and update documentation
